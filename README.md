# Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Hexcrawl
Companion App for the Hexcrawl portion of Pathfinder Kingmaker TTRPG

This application is a companion for the Hexcrawl portion of the Kingmaker Adventure Path for Pathfinder 2nd Edition.

Features:

• The whole map of the Stolen Lands, left click to move, the party icon will move to the center of the hex clicked; mouse scroll to zoom in/out; mouse scroll click to drag the map around;
  
• Triggers when the party moves to a Hex with an event;
  
• Events that require some kind of check to find are hidden and show up upon pressing the Search Button;

• Encounter Rolls: Push the Encounter button to roll on the encounter table. This does not roll a flat 17 check to see if an encounter will happen, it rolls directly on the encounter table. This is location based and rolls on the table accordingly to the Zone the party icon is;

• Weather Rolls: Push the Weather button to roll on the weather table found on the Kingmaker Adventure Path Companion Guide. It rolls a flat 17 check and if it passes it rolls again on the weather table. This is NOT location based, it may rolls weather events that are not suitable for the current Hex (I may or may not update this in the future);

• Change Icon: Change the player icon;

• Show/Hide Buttons: Push the top right button to hide/reveal the buttons on the screen;

• Hide Rolls: Push the eye to conceal the results of Encounter and Weather Rolls (it still shows the number rolled, but hides the result of the roll)

Know bugs:

• Upon pushing Weather and Encounter button it reveals the text with a Fade In/Out that lasts 3 seconds. Pushing the button during this three seconds may mess up future pushes of the buttons;

• There is no button to close the application, quit it with [Alt]+[F4].
